# Scalable and Secure Web Application

*_Objective:_*

We're planning to launch a new web application. You are to create a
Terraform script that sets up an AWS environment with an auto-scaling EC2 setup
behind a load balancer, and an RDS instance, ensuring secure communication
between them.

*_Deliverable:_*

Provide the Terraform scripts and a README file that explains the
architecture and instructions to execute the scripts.
